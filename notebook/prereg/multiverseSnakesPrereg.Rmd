# Introduction

<!-- Science should be self correcting -->
<!-- Alberts et al 2015 -->

<!-- Self-correction can be more ephemeral, not limited to direct hard replications -->
<!-- Peterson, Panosky 2021 -->

<!-- reproducibility crisis -->
<!-- Baker 2016 -->

* Science should be self correcting

A key component of science is the continual reassessment of past work and findings.
Whether that takes the form of "integrative replications" or quasi-replications<!-- see peterson paper for definition check . Also add quasi-rep citation --> testing the edges of previous findings generalisability and retesting questions in different study systems, or as direct replications aiming to discover how exactly how reliable previous work is.

<!-- Direct quote from Peterson 2021 - "When replication in the normal course of integration does not provide clear signals of truth or falsity, researchers instead look for signs of robustness." -->

* Reassessments of old data have reveal inconsistencies

Reassessments and replications - regardless of their position on the direct-quasi continuum - can aid the formal and organic self-correcting process of science.

Complex and difficult to control for ecological system (high task uncertainty) largely prohibit direct diagnostic replications.


* We can't always collect more data, rechecking old data and conclusions an (albeit not replaceable) alternative

<!-- peterson pano 2021 has a bit about "task uncertainty" where high perfectly describes ecology and the hard to control system -->

* Computational reproducibility is important, but sometimes new methods appear that might offer additionally insight or is more robust to data structural issues.

* methods impact results and therefore conclusions, we can see such impact in many analysts and multiverses

<!-- ecology has high "task uncertainty" stemming from high "technical" and "strategic task uncertainty" - Peterson pano 2021 -->

<!-- Peterson pano 2021 has a great line that when task uncertainty is higher and more uncontrollable variables exists then integrative replications are more open to interpretation. -->

* movement ecology has seen such development in methods, can we check the conclusions remain the same

* as a case study, we re-examine the findings from __ snake movement studies that all describe a form of habitat selection

<!-- devezer et al 2021 - reproducing the results doesn't mean that they are more likely correct - pg 10. So instead here we are exploring the likely that conclusions would change, an attempt to gauge uncertainty with a number of ~equally~ valid analysis methods -->

<!-- Direct quote from Peterson 2021 - "When replication in the normal course of integration does not provide clear signals of truth or falsity, researchers instead look for signs of robustness." -->

# Software availablity

In addition to packages already mentioned in the methods we also used the following.

We used *R* `r paste0("v.", version$major, ".", version$minor)` [@base] via *RStudio* v.2023.6.2.561 [@rstudio]. <!-- version has to be manually added because rstudioapi doesn't work in targets -->
We used *here* `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("here"))` [@here] and *qs* `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("qs"))` [@qs] to manage directory addresses and saved objects.

We used *raster* `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("raster"))` [@raster] and *RandomFields* `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("RandomFields"))` [@RandomFields] to aid landscape raster creation alongside NLMR `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("NLMR"))` [@NLMR].

We used *ggplot2* `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("ggplot2"))` for creating figures [@ggplot2], with the expansions: *patchwork* `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("patchwork"))` [@patchwork], *ggridges* `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("ggridges"))` [@ggridges], and *ggdist* `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("ggdist"))` [@ggdist].

We used *brms* `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("brms"))` [@brms] to run Bayesian models, with diagnostics generated used *bayesplot* `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("bayesplot"))` [@bayesplot], *tidybayes* `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("tidybayes"))` [@tidybayes], and *performance* `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("performance"))` [@performance].

We used the *dplyr* `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("dplyr"))` [@dplyr], *tibble* `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("tibble"))` [@tibble],
<!-- *reshape2* `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("reshape2"))` [@reshape2], -->
and *stringr* `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("stringr"))` [@stringr] packages for data manipulation.

We used *sp* `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("sp"))` [@sp], *move* `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("move"))` [@move] for manipulation of spatial data and estimation of space use not otherwise mentioned in the methods.

We used rmarkdown `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("rmarkdown"))` [@rmarkdown2023; @rmarkdown2018; @rmarkdown2020], bookdown `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("bookdown"))` [@bookdown2016; @R-bookdown], tinytex `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("tinytex"))` [@tinytex2019; @tinytex2023], and knitr `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("knitr"))` [@knitr2015; @knitr2014; @knitr2023] packages to generate type-set outputs.

We generated R package citations with the aid of *grateful* `r paste0("v.", packageVersion("grateful"))` [@grateful].
