abstract: PLACEHOLDER ABSTRACT Possibly the best way to determine a snake’s needs is to follow their movements. Once we have learnt of the snake’s movements we can infer habitat requirements, behaviour, and potential threats. Combined, the movement data and inferences can inform decisions on snake conservation and human snake conflict. However, extracting useful information from snake movement requires many steps, from sampling to analysis. Other studies have shown that a single dataset can result in many different answers in the hands of different researchers, so how can we be confident the results from snake movement are leading to the correct decisions in snake conservation? We used a multiverse approach to explore thousands of ways of extracting the habitat preference estimates from the movement of simulated snakes with a pre-defined preference. We found that despite different sampling approaches, and completely different analysis methods, the vast majority of results agree and correctly identify habitat preference. The agreement between different habitat preference estimates tended to be better with more data, and when using more modern analysis methods. Now we plan to apply this multiverse of analyses to re-examine several previous studies of snake habitat preference from Thailand. We will examine how the published results compare to the thousands of other ways a researcher could have examined the snake movement data. Would certain analysis choices have led to a different conclusion and therefore a different conservation recommendation? We hope the answers to these questions will inform how confident we can be in the findings from snake movement studies and direct us towards more robust studies in the future.

# Introduction

<!-- Science should be self correcting -->
<!-- Alberts et al 2015 -->

<!-- Self-correction can be more ephemeral, not limited to direct hard replications -->
<!-- Peterson, Panosky 2021 -->

<!-- reproducibility crisis -->
<!-- Baker 2016 -->
<!-- \usepackage[bitstream-charter]{mathdesign} -->
<!-- \usepackage[charter]{mathdesign} -->

A key component of science is the continual reassessment of past work and findings [@alberts_self-correction_2015].
Whether that takes the form of direct replications aiming to discover exactly how reliable previous work is, or more integrative approaches testing the edges of previous findings' generalisability and retesting questions in different study systems [@nakagawa_replicating_2015; @peterson_self-correction_2021]. <!-- see peterson paper for definition check . Also add quasi-rep citation --> 

<!-- Direct quote from Peterson 2021 - "When replication in the normal course of integration does not provide clear signals of truth or falsity, researchers instead look for signs of robustness." -->

Reassessments and replications --regardless of their position on the direct-quasi continuum-- can aid the formal and organic self-correcting process of science.
Initial findings set the stage for subsequent work, building momentum that can accelerate progress, but this momentum can be difficult to redirect if the initial impetus was misdirected [@jennions_relationships_2002; @barto_dissemination_2012] <!-- thinking the progress papers, think it was by barto about early research that is underpowered starting trends that are hard to stop -->.
Therefore, checking and confirming results early is important; we can see this principle recognised in the peer review system itself.

Checking previous findings through replication can be come more difficult in systems with high task uncertainty. 
High task uncertainty systems –those that manifest high levels of uncontrollable stochasticity– may make direct diagnostic replications impractical or impossible, and render the evidence from quasi-replications weaker <!-- peterson pano 2021 is the paper for this stuff -->[@peterson_self-correction_2021].
Ecological systems can be considered as generating high task uncertainty, with many interconnected elements, and when studying wild systems many of those elements are uncontrollable.
<!-- peterson pano 2021 has a bit about "task uncertainty" where high perfectly describes ecology and the hard to control system -->

With ecological systems, such complexity and the difficulty to control an experiment makes direct replications costly, potentially explaining their rarity [@kelly_rate_2019].
When studying wild animals with a level of direct intervention, repeating experiments might be unethical due to the well-being costs [@Weatherhead2004; @tomotani_great_2021; @robstad_impact_2021; @portugal_externally_2022; @altobelli_methods_2022]. 

<!-- could add a couple more examples here -->
When faced with limited options for direct replications, an alternative, albeit not a replacement, would be to re-examine existing datasets.
Pooling old and new datasets, and reanalysising them, may provide opportunities for broader generalisations.

In some cases older data may have been collected and recorded in ways that enables completely fresh analysis [@kays_movebank_2022].
As methodologies develop, conceptualisations change, and computational power increases, new avenues for examining the same data may materialise [e.g., @noonan_effects_2020].
As these new methods are developed and applied, we may see the conclusions based upon those data change.
There are a growing number of examples demonstrating that the analysis approach can alter the results [@salis_how_2021; @desbureaux_subjective_2021], and that the researchers themselves can be a key source of variation in analysis and results [@silberzahn_many_2018; @huntingtonklein_influence_2021; @gould_same_2023].
These examples elegantly show the possible extent of technical uncertainty present in some systems<!-- peterson and pano term again, needs defining -->.

Not all disciplines have explored the sources of uncertainty in findings equally.
Prudence would push for examination of uncertainty in all its forms, in particular for fields that already tackle high levels of uncertainty originating from a wild study system.
Movement ecology could be argued to exemplify such a field.
Animals are complex, existing in complex wild ecosystems, with individuality and personality [@stuber_spatial_2022].
Depending on the research question, controls in movement ecology can be difficult to achieve, and replications difficult to justify given the strict ethical limitations on interventionist study.
Movement ecology has also seized the opportunities presented by technological developments, enabling higher resolution tracking of animal movements (e.g., GPS tracking) and more sophisticated analysis that can integrate the high dimensional data [e.g., x-y coordinates, time, acceleration, individual, other covariates of interest, @joo_recent_2022].

Personality and the repeatability of behaviours presents a key component to the uncertainty or variation when attempting to generalise.
However, here we turn to the technical uncertainty, the uncertainty originating from the researcher and how they approach the data.
Previous many analyst projects highlight the potential for analyst-side variation [@silberzahn_many_2018; @huntingtonklein_influence_2021; @gould_same_2023], and previous multiverse explorations of movement ecology methods highlight the variation potentially presented within a synthetic movement dataset <!-- FIRST PREPRINTS HERE -->[chapter 2 and 3 preprints can be cited here when published in June].
Here we take the multiverse approach further by applying it to a number of real case studies with the aim of exploration whether different analysis approaches could have altered the final general conclusions.

<!-- ecology has high "task uncertainty" stemming from high "technical" and "strategic task uncertainty" - Peterson pano 2021 -->

<!-- Peterson pano 2021 has a great line that when task uncertainty is higher and more uncontrollable variables exists then integrative replications are more open to interpretation. -->

We selected a quartet of separate but connected movement ecology studies that attempt to disentangle the habitat selection exhibited by snakes in north-eastern Thailand.
All four cases focus on snakes that come into conflict with humans to some extent, either because of the risks poses from their venom (King Cobra @Marshall2018 & @marshall_no_2020, Malayan Krait @hodges_malayan_2022, Banded Krait @knierim_spatial_2019), or because of their appetite for domestic livestock (Burmese python @smith_native_2021).
In all cases the habitat selection results could be used to guide snake conservation efforts, as well as interventions into human behaviour to mitigate human-snake conflict.
With these general goals in mind, we aim to re-examine the movement datasets using a multiverse of habitat selection analysis pathways to reveal whether the same data could lead to different conclusions.

<!-- devezer et al 2021 - reproducing the results doesn't mean that they are more likely correct - pg 10. So instead here we are exploring the likely that conclusions would change, an attempt to gauge uncertainty with a number of ~equally~ valid analysis methods -->

<!-- Direct quote from Peterson 2021 - "When replication in the normal course of integration does not provide clear signals of truth or falsity, researchers instead look for signs of robustness." -->

# Methods

## Study Location
<!-- NE Thailand -->
All four case studies occurred in north eastern Thailand, within Nakhon Ratchasima province.
<!-- SERS -->
Three case studies (King Cobra, Burmese Python, Banded Krait) were conducted within the Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve.
The reserve comprises of three zones of management: core, buffer, and transitional.
The core is largely primary forest; the buffer surrounds the core and is comprised of forest regeneration efforts, whereas the transitional zone allows more development resulting in a mix of agriculture, settlements, and plantation forest.
Bisecting the transitional zone, and running adjacent to the protected forest areas is a four-lane highway connecting the city of Nakhon Ratchasima to Bangkok.
<!-- SUT University campus -->
The case study (Malayan Krait) not in the Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve was undertaken nearer to Nakhon Ratchasima proper, on the Suranaree University of Technology campus.
The university campus is a mix of scrub forest, open lawn, university buildings, and homes.
Further details on the study sites' characteristics can be found in the original publications [@Marshall2018; @marshall_no_2020; @smith_native_2021; @hodges_malayan_2022; @knierim_spatial_2019].

<!-- enough detail? and double check the match the orignal papers -->

### Study Species and Hypotheses

Snakes can be difficult to detect in wild scenarios [@Durso2015; @boback_use_2020], forcing a wider and more opportunistic suite of methods to gather adequate sample sizes.
In all the chosen case studies snakes were obtained for study using trapping arrays, active surveying, and notifications from locals.
The local notifications often arose from snakes entering human settlements, and a desire for the snake to be removed.
<!-- maybe summary table here of capture methods -->

The four case studies cover four snake species, each with their own ecology and movements.

#### King Cobra

@Marshall2018 and @marshall_no_2020 are concerned with King Cobras (*Ophiophagus hannah*).
King Cobras are a large (tracked individuals between 1.40 and 3.71m snout to vent length), diurnal, active foraging snake species that depredate snakes and monitor lizards [@Jones_supposed_2020].
While considered a predominately forest dwelling species [@Stuart2012], they are know to make use of more human altered areas [@Whitaker2004; @Rao2013; @jones_how_2022], which can lead to frequent in human-snake conflict [@Shankar2013a; @Marshall2018b].
The extremely low occurrence of King Cobra bites in Thailand mean that instances of human-snake conflict are primarily a conservation concern as opposed to human health [@Pochanugool1998; @Viravan1992].

@Marshall2018 does not conclude on an actual selection, instead highlighting the King Cobras excursions out of the protected forest.
@marshall_no_2020 looks more specifically at selection, highlighting the importance of semi-natural areas that occupy the banks of irrigation canals and intersection the agricultural areas surrounding the protected forest.
Therefore, we will pool both datasets and examine two non-mutually exclusion hypotheses that can be examined through a unified model.

H~OPHA1~: King Cobras select for semi-natural habitat

H~OPHA2~: King Cobras select for forest habitat

#### Burmese Python

@smith_native_2021 describe Burmese Python (*Python bivittatus*) habitat selection and movement.
Burmese Pythons are large (tracked individuals between  2.21 and 3.09m snout to vent length), ambush predators capable of tacking prey over 100% their own body mass [@bartoszek_natural_2018] and impacting mammal populations [@dorcas_severe_2012].
The flexibility in regards to prey size means snakes of this size are inevitably draw into conflict with humans over livestock, a pattern mirrored across the globe for large snakes [@Miranda2016].

The conclusions of @smith_native_2021 on python habitat selection are not dissimilar to those made on King Cobras, with an active selection for areas near water.
The land classification used in @smith_native_2021 was slightly different to @marshall_no_2020, grouping semi-natural areas with larger water bodies (e.g., agricultural ponds).

H~PYBI1~: Burmese Pythons select for areas near water.

#### Malayan Krait

@hodges_malayan_2022 examine a smaller species, the Malayan Krait (*Bungarus candidus*). 
The Malayan Kraits tracked were between 0.65 and 1.46m snout to vent, and all lived on a university campus. 
Malayan Kraits like many elapids, have a potent and medically significant venom; bites of Malayan Kraits can be fatal [@looareesuwan_factors_1988; @searo_regional_office_for_the_south_east_asia_rgo_guidelines_2016].
They are (mostly) nocturnal and actively foraging [@hodges_deadly_2021], known to depredate a range for prey [e.g., @hodges_diurnal_2020, @kuch_notes_nodate].

Unlike the other case studies, @hodges_malayan_2022 is undertaken in a more urban environment.
The scale of the Malayan Krait movements meant the study was conducted at a finer spatial scale; habitat types are therefore more finely separated (e.g., buildings vs settlements).
The overall conclusions highlight a number of habitat types that potentially being selected for, and in opposition an avoidance of open areas.

H~BUCA1~: Malayan Kraits select for buildings, settlements, and natural areas.

#### Banded Krait

@knierim_spatial_2019 looked at a larger krait species, the Banded Krait (*Bungarus fasciatus*).
Like its smaller cousin the Banded Krait is also a nocturnal active forager, with a potent venom.
The Banded Krait is heavier bodies and grows to longer lengths, tracked individuals ranging from 1.13 and 1.58 m snout to vent length.
However, unlike the Malayan Krait, the Banded Krait appears less tolerant of human disturbance in this region of Thailand and tends to have a more ophiophagus diet [@Knierim2017a].

Banded Kraits were entirely located in agricultural land, and like the other krait had movements more conducive to finer habitat classifications.
For example, field margins were found as a key nesting site [@knierim_spatial_2019].
@knierim_spatial_2019 shows that importance is reflected in the movements and habitat selection, as Banded Kraits follow the linear water or field margin features as opposed to the wider more exposed field areas.

H~BUFA1~: Banded Kraits select for waterways and field edges.
