Here we synthesise biotelemetry methods and outcomes from the past two decades of published studies (n = 128; 1 January 2000–31 December 2020). We discuss trends in amphibian study duration, transmitter weight and transmitter attachment methods. The most commonly used harness designs for external transmitter attachment and surgical methods for internal implantation are described, and the beneﬁts and potential problems of these methods are discussed. We recommend improved practices for future studies and address gaps within the current amphibian telemetry literature in regard to accurately reporting study endpoints and study subject survival. Finally, we highlight emerging technologies that could inﬂuence the next 20 years of telemetry research on amphibians.},
