Here we synthesise biotelemetry methods and outcomes from the past two decades of published studies (n = 128; 1 January 2000–31 December 2020). We discuss trends in amphibian study duration, transmitter weight and transmitter attachment methods. The most commonly used harness designs for external transmitter attachment and surgical methods for internal implantation are described, and the beneﬁts and potential problems of these methods are discussed. We recommend improved practices for future studies and address gaps within the current amphibian telemetry literature in regard to accurately reporting study endpoints and study subject survival. Finally, we highlight emerging technologies that could inﬂuence the next 20 years of telemetry research on amphibians.},

  abstract = {Transect surveys are frequently used to estimate distribution and abundance of species across a landscape, yet a proportion of individuals present will be missed because either they were out of view and unavailable for detection or they were available but not detected because the surveyors missed them. These situations lead to availability and perception bias, respectively, and can result in misleading estimates of abundance and habitat use. In this study, we examined potential biases of visual surveys used for the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis), a cryptic invasive snake responsible for the extirpation of at least 15 vertebrates on Guam. We simultaneously executed visual surveys and radiotelemetry in a lowdensity population of brown tree snakes with two goals in mind: to assess the efﬁcacy of visual surveys in detecting subjects at low densities and to identify sources of perception and availability bias in such surveys. Results indicated that with considerable effort, visual surveys can predict the presence of this cryptic reptile even at low densities (0.4 animals/ha) but perform poorly at predicting areas of high use resulting in inaccurate estimates of relative habitat importance. Telemetered snakes used densely foliated plants including Pandanus tectorius and ferns (epiphytic and terrestrial species) for nearly half of their time, yet {\textless}9\% of visual survey observations occurred in these microhabitats. Visibility of snakes decreased as they perched higher in the canopy mirroring the disparity between visual survey and telemetry detections but was also surprisingly low near the forest ﬂoor (0–1 m). Microhabitats identiﬁed in this study are likely to disproportionately affect visual surveys and would be appropriate resources to target for management purposes. When there is critical need to prevent false negatives, such as during an incipient invasion elsewhere, targeted searches of high-use resources could augment other detection tools to improve detection probabilities of this and other cryptic species.},

Documenting feeding habits of snakes in nature can be difficult due to their low detectability and long intervals between feeding bouts (Maritz et al., 2018).

We sampled habitat locations of five radio-tagged King Cobras in the Western Ghats of Karnataka, India, from December 2010 to April 2011. Habitat preferences were investigated based on use of retreat sites from radio-implanted animals. While sampling for known retreat sites, 30 additional sightings of wild adult non-radio- tagged King Cobras were recorded. Sex based differences in habitat use were studied by sampling nest sites. The data were analyzed using generalized linear models (GLM) for the binary presence dataset. We found King Cobra movement patterns are strongly influenced by ambient temperature, relative humidity and wind direction. King Cobras did not show strong preferences for any particular habitat type. King Cobras likely prefer areas close to streams with abundant fallen logs as retreat sites. Animal burrows were also used as shelter sites. Areas with a leaf litter depth of 10–17 cm were preferred sites for nest construction.},

  abstract = {Protected areas are often promoted as an important solution to preserving biodiversity. However, permeable edges can undermine the effectiveness of preserves because animals may move into adjacent human-dominated unprotected areas. We investigated attitudes toward, and sources of mortality of, a far-ranging apex predator, the king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah; Cantor 1836), in a biosphere reserve in northeastern Thailand. Our questionnaire revealed marked fear of snakes and hostility toward king cobras. Using radiotelemetry, we followed 23 king cobras over a 4-year period, during which time we documented the mortality of 14 individuals. We considered 10 of the deaths to be anthropogenic in origin, including road mortality, pollution, fish traps, and direct persecution; these deaths disproportionately occurred in unprotected areas. Our results highlight how dangerous human-dominated landscapes are for king cobras. Because king cobras move long distances and maintain large home ranges, it is likely that successful conservation of the species cannot be satisfactorily met by protected areas alone; a more holistic, education-focused conservation strategy is required. We stress the importance of a human dimensions approach that leads toward greater understanding of human attitudes toward king cobras, and snakes in general, combined with ecological research for more effective conservation.},

Of these, 1,415 were bitten by venomous snakes, 91 by neurotoxic snakes of genus Naja or Bungarus and 1,324 by snakes of family Viperidae or Crotalidae. Seventy-one percent of bites were on the lower extremity. There were two fatal cobra bites; both patients were dead on arrival at the hospital. Bites from vipers caused morbidity but no deaths. Species-specific antivenins are effective in reversing respiratory failure from cobra bites and coagulopathies from bites by Viperidae and Crotalidae snakes. However, early respiratory and wound care will save lives even in the absence of specific cobra and krait antivenin. Care of a snakebite victim should consist of immobilization and bandaging of the bitten limb with elastic bandages during transport to the hospital, early surgical debridement of necrotic tissue, appropriate infusion of antivenin, aggressive respiratory support, management of shock and infection, and peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. Incision of bite wounds, suctioning, application of ice, and tourniquets are of no proven value and may be dangerous. All snakebite victims in southeast Asia should survive if they receive early competent care.},

Of the 1631 snakes collected, 1145 were venomous: Malayan pit vipers (Calloselasma rhodostoma), green pit vipers (Trimeresurus albolabris) and Russell’s vipers (Daboia russelii) were the most numerous, while T. albolabris, C. rhodostoma and spitting cobras (‘Naja atra’) were the most widely distributed. In 22 cases, non-venomous species were mistaken for venomous ones and antivenom was used unnecessarily. The Malayan krait (Bungarus candidus) was confused with B. fasciatus in 5 cases and B. fasciatus antivenom was used inappropriately. The study extended the known ranges of most of the medically-important venomous species in Thailand. Correct identification of venomous snakes is especially important in Thailand because the locally-produced antivenoms are monospecific. The technique of hospital-based collection, labelling and preservation of dead snakes brought by bitten patients is recommended when rapid assessment of a country’s medically important herpetofauna is required. © Oxford University Press.},

	abstract = {The genus Bungarus comprises medically important venomous snakes of the Oriental region, which have predominantly nocturnal and snake-eating habits. Faecal samples of two adult specimens of the Malayan Krait (Bungarus candidus) from northwestern Java were found to contain hair and incisors of adult, mouse-size rodents. This record is the first to provide evidence that rodents are part of the prey spectrum of wild B. candidus. The Malayan Krait is frequently found in rice fields and other agricultural areas, and its potential contribution to the natural control of rodent populations is discussed. In feeding experiments with recently collected Malayan Kraits, synbranchid eels (Monopterus albus) were also eaten. Captive B. candidus are known to thrive on a diet of small rats and mice.},
