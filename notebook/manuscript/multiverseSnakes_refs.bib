Here we synthesise biotelemetry methods and outcomes from the past two decades of published studies (n = 128; 1 January 2000–31 December 2020). We discuss trends in amphibian study duration, transmitter weight and transmitter attachment methods. The most commonly used harness designs for external transmitter attachment and surgical methods for internal implantation are described, and the beneﬁts and potential problems of these methods are discussed. We recommend improved practices for future studies and address gaps within the current amphibian telemetry literature in regard to accurately reporting study endpoints and study subject survival. Finally, we highlight emerging technologies that could inﬂuence the next 20 years of telemetry research on amphibians.},

Documenting feeding habits of snakes in nature can be difficult due to their low detectability and long intervals between feeding bouts (Maritz et al., 2018). Radiotelemetry allows researchers to reliably locate individuals, making it possible to document predation by direct observation in the field.},

  abstract = {King Cobras are the largest of all venomous snakes. Thus, they have a unique role in the ecosystem. We sampled habitat locations of five radio-tagged King Cobras in the Western Ghats of Karnataka, India, from December 2010 to April 2011. Habitat preferences were investigated based on use of retreat sites from radio-implanted animals. While sampling for known retreat sites, 30 additional sightings of wild adult non-radio- tagged King Cobras were recorded. Sex based differences in habitat use were studied by sampling nest sites. The data were analyzed using generalized linear models (GLM) for the binary presence dataset. We found King Cobra movement patterns are strongly influenced by ambient temperature, relative humidity and wind direction. King Cobras did not show strong preferences for any particular habitat type. King Cobras likely prefer areas close to streams with abundant fallen logs as retreat sites. Animal burrows were also used as shelter sites. Areas with a leaf litter depth of 10–17 cm were preferred sites for nest construction.},

  abstract = {Protected areas are often promoted as an important solution to preserving biodiversity. However, permeable edges can undermine the effectiveness of preserves because animals may move into adjacent human-dominated unprotected areas. We investigated attitudes toward, and sources of mortality of, a far-ranging apex predator, the king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah; Cantor 1836), in a biosphere reserve in northeastern Thailand. Our questionnaire revealed marked fear of snakes and hostility toward king cobras. Using radiotelemetry, we followed 23 king cobras over a 4-year period, during which time we documented the mortality of 14 individuals. We considered 10 of the deaths to be anthropogenic in origin, including road mortality, pollution, fish traps, and direct persecution; these deaths disproportionately occurred in unprotected areas. Our results highlight how dangerous human-dominated landscapes are for king cobras. Because king cobras move long distances and maintain large home ranges, it is likely that successful conservation of the species cannot be satisfactorily met by protected areas alone; a more holistic, education-focused conservation strategy is required. We stress the importance of a human dimensions approach that leads toward greater understanding of human attitudes toward king cobras, and snakes in general, combined with ecological research for more effective conservation.},

Of these, 1,415 were bitten by venomous snakes, 91 by neurotoxic snakes of genus Naja or Bungarus and 1,324 by snakes of family Viperidae or Crotalidae. Seventy-one percent of bites were on the lower extremity. There were two fatal cobra bites; both patients were dead on arrival at the hospital. Bites from vipers caused morbidity but no deaths. Species-specific antivenins are effective in reversing respiratory failure from cobra bites and coagulopathies from bites by Viperidae and Crotalidae snakes. However, early respiratory and wound care will save lives even in the absence of specific cobra and krait antivenin. Care of a snakebite victim should consist of immobilization and bandaging of the bitten limb with elastic bandages during transport to the hospital, early surgical debridement of necrotic tissue, appropriate infusion of antivenin, aggressive respiratory support, management of shock and infection, and peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. Incision of bite wounds, suctioning, application of ice, and tourniquets are of no proven value and may be dangerous. All snakebite victims in southeast Asia should survive if they receive early competent care.},

  abstract = {Snakes which had been killed and brought to hospital with the patients they had bitten were collected in 80 district and provincial hospitals throughout 67 provinces in Thailand in order to establish the geographical distribution and relative medical importance of the venomous species. Of the 1631 snakes collected, 1145 were venomous: Malayan pit vipers (Calloselasma rhodostoma), green pit vipers (Trimeresurus albolabris) and Russell’s vipers (Daboia russelii) were the most numerous, while T. albolabris, C. rhodostoma and spitting cobras (‘Naja atra’) were the most widely distributed. In 22 cases, non-venomous species were mistaken for venomous ones and antivenom was used unnecessarily. The Malayan krait (Bungarus candidus) was confused with B. fasciatus in 5 cases and B. fasciatus antivenom was used inappropriately. The study extended the known ranges of most of the medically-important venomous species in Thailand. Correct identification of venomous snakes is especially important in Thailand because the locally-produced antivenoms are monospecific. The technique of hospital-based collection, labelling and preservation of dead snakes brought by bitten patients is recommended when rapid assessment of a country’s medically important herpetofauna is required. © Oxford University Press.},

          Researchers are intrinsically part of the research process. While we may strive for objectivity, there are always judgement calls required during research. When you ask ten researchers to answer the same question with the same dataset, you will likely receive ten different answers. This variation in answers has been linked to several disciplines’ replication crises. Here, we explore whether answers from movement ecology, specifically habitat selection, vary as a result of differing analytical choices. We conducted a multiverse analysis on around 400 synthetic animal movement datasets, exploring a multitude of analysis pathways to determine habitat selection, resulting in approximately half a million unique estimates of selection. By using simulated virtual animals with a known preference, we were able to show which decisions during analysis could lead to more variable estimates of habitat selection. The multiverse revealed that data quantity (i.e., tracking frequency and duration) was more important to obtaining consistent answers than any analysis choice. Overall, the pattern of estimates shows the majority of analysis pathways provide similar final results, particularly for modern analysis methods. The pattern reflects findings from other disciplines, indicating that while movement ecology is not immune to issues of non-replicability stemming from researcher choice, it is also not at any greater risk than other disciplines.},

	abstract = {Snakebite causes more than 1.8 million envenoming cases annually and is a major cause of death in the tropics especially for poor farmers. While both social and ecological factors influence the chance encounter between snakes and people, the spatio-temporal processes underlying snakebites remain poorly explored. Previous research has focused on statistical correlates between snakebites and ecological, sociological, or environmental factors, but the human and snake behavioral patterns that drive the spatio-temporal process have not yet been integrated into a single model. Here we use a bottom-up simulation approach using agent-based modelling (ABM) parameterized with datasets from Sri Lanka, a snakebite hotspot, to characterise the mechanisms of snakebite and identify risk factors. Spatio-temporal dynamics of snakebite risks are examined through the model incorporating six snake species and three farmer types (rice, tea, and rubber). We find that snakebites are mainly climatically driven, but the risks also depend on farmer types due to working schedules as well as species present in landscapes. Snake species are differentiated by both distribution and by habitat preference, and farmers are differentiated by working patterns that are climatically driven, and the combination of these factors leads to unique encounter rates for different landcover types as well as locations. Validation using epidemiological studies demonstrated that our model can explain observed patterns, including temporal patterns of snakebite incidence, and relative contribution of bites by each snake species. Our predictions can be used to generate hypotheses and inform future studies and decision makers. Additionally, our model is transferable to other locations with high snakebite burden as well.},

	abstract = {The lack of public awareness surrounding the dangers of snakebite envenomation (SBE) is one of the most critical factors contributing to SBE-induced complications, and subsequently exacerbating the number of deaths and disabilities resulting from SBE. In this study, we deployed a multifaceted community education programme to educate students, healthcare professionals and members of the public in rural areas of Tamil Nadu, India about the dangers of SBE, appropriate first aid measures and the ‘do’s and don’ts’ following a snakebite. An assessment of prior knowledge within these communities identified several misconceptions concerning snakes and SBE. Using a combination of direct engagement (estimated to reach over 200,000 people), information leaflets (200,000 distributed), posters, video documentaries, media and social media ({\textgreater}2.8 million engagements), over the course of one year (January to December 2019) we reached over 3 million people in rural Tamil Nadu (around 8\% of population). Evaluation of community-based assemblies indicated that at least 90\% of attendees were able to recall the key messages at the end of the events, and at least 85\% were able to recall the key messages even after 12 months. Due to high demand, a one-day symposium was organised to provide clinical knowledge and training on SBE to 250 healthcare professionals in rural Tamil Nadu. Notably, an assessment of patient data (291 victims) collected from a snakebite referral hospital over the same 12-month period (2019) indicated that arrival time at hospital following a snakebite was significantly faster and the effective first aid measures were administered to patients who were aware of our activities compared to those that were not. Overall, our approach provides a framework on how to educate rural communities about the dangers of SBE and thereby, mitigate delayed SBE treatment leading to an overall reduction in SBE-induced mortality, morbidity, treatment costs and other socio-economic ramifications.},

	abstract = {Reptiles are the most species-rich terrestrial vertebrate group with a broad diversity of life history traits. Biotelemetry is an essential methodology for studying reptiles as it compensates for several limitations when studying their natural history. We evaluated trends in terrestrial reptile spatial ecology studies focusing upon quantifying home ranges for the past twenty years. We assessed 290 English-language reptile home range studies published from 2000–2019 via a structured literature review investigating publications’ study location, taxonomic group, methodology, reporting, and analytical techniques. Substantial biases remain in both location and taxonomic groups in the literature, with nearly half of all studies (45\%) originating from the USA. Snakes were most often studied, and crocodiles were least often studied, while testudines tended to have the greatest within study sample sizes. More than half of all studies lacked critical methodological details, limiting the number of studies for inclusion in future meta-analyses (55\% of studies lacked information on individual tracking durations, and 51\% lacked sufficient information on the number of times researchers recorded positions). Studies continue to rely on outdated methods to quantify space-use (including Minimum Convex Polygons and Kernel Density Estimators), often failing to report subtleties regarding decisions that have substantial impact on home range area estimates. Moving forward researchers can select a suite of appropriate analytical techniques tailored to their research question (dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models for within sample interpolation, and autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimators for beyond sample extrapolation). Only 1.4\% of all evaluated studies linked to available and usable telemetry data, further hindering scientific consensus. We ultimately implore herpetologists to adopt transparent reporting practices and make liberal use of open data platforms to maximize progress in the field of reptile spatial ecology.},

	abstract = {Patterns of resource selection by animal populations emerge as a result of the behavior of many individuals. Statistical models that describe these population-level patterns of habitat use can miss important interactions between individual animals and characteristics of their local environment; however, identifying these interactions is difﬁcult. One approach to this problem is to incorporate models of individual movement into resource selection models. To do this, we propose a model for step selection functions (SSF) that is composed of a resource-independent movement kernel and a resource selection function (RSF). We show that standard case-control logistic regression may be used to ﬁt the SSF; however, the sampling scheme used to generate control points (i.e., the deﬁnition of availability) must be accommodated. We used three sampling schemes to analyze simulated movement data and found that ignoring sampling and the resource-independent movement kernel yielded biased estimates of selection. The level of bias depended on the method used to generate control locations, the strength of selection, and the spatial scale of the resource map. Using empirical or parametric methods to sample control locations produced biased estimates under stronger selection; however, we show that the addition of a distance function to the analysis substantially reduced that bias. Assuming a uniform availability within a ﬁxed buffer yielded strongly biased selection estimates that could be corrected by including the distance function but remained inefﬁcient relative to the empirical and parametric sampling methods. As a case study, we used location data collected from elk in Yellowstone National Park, USA, to show that selection and bias may be temporally variable. Because under constant selection the amount of bias depends on the scale at which a resource is distributed in the landscape, we suggest that distance always be included as a covariate in SSF analyses. This approach to modeling resource selection is easily implemented using common statistical tools and promises to provide deeper insight into the movement ecology of animals.},

	abstract = {* Movement ecology has developed rapidly over the past decade, driven by advances in tracking technology that have largely removed data limitations. Development of rigorous analytical tools has lagged behind empirical progress, and as a result, relocation data sets have been underutilized.   * Discrete-time correlated random walk models (CRW) have long served as the foundation for analyzing relocation data. Unfortunately, CRWs confound the sampling and movement processes. CRW parameter estimates thus depend sensitively on the sampling schedule, which makes it difficult to draw sampling-independent inferences about the underlying movement process. Furthermore, CRWs cannot accommodate the multiscale autocorrelations that typify modern, finely sampled relocation data sets.   * Recent developments in modelling movement as a continuous-time stochastic process (CTSP) solve these problems, but the mathematical difficulty of using CTSPs has limited their adoption in ecology. To remove this roadblock, we introduce the ctmm package for the R statistical computing environment. ctmm implements all of the CTSPs currently in use in the ecological literature and couples them with powerful statistical methods for autocorrelated data adapted from geostatistics and signal processing, including variograms, periodograms and non-Markovian maximum likelihood estimation.   * ctmm is built around a standard workflow that begins with visual diagnostics, proceeds to candidate model identification, and then to maximum likelihood fitting and AIC-based model selection. Once an accurate CTSP for the data has been fitted and selected, analyses that require such a model, such as quantifying home range areas via autocorrelated kernel density estimation or estimating occurrence distributions via time-series Kriging, can then be performed.   * We use a case study with African buffalo to demonstrate the capabilities of ctmm and highlight the steps of a typical CTSP movement analysis workflow.},

	volume = {96},
	abstract = {Quantifying animals’ home ranges is a key problem in ecology and has important conservation and wildlife management applications. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is a workhorse technique for range delineation problems that is both statistically efficient and nonparametric. KDE assumes that the data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, animal tracking data, which are routinely used as inputs to KDEs, are inherently autocorrelated and violate this key assumption. As we demonstrate, using realistically autocorrelated data in conventional KDEs results in grossly underestimated home ranges. We further show that the performance of conventional KDEs actually degrades as data quality improves, because autocorrelation strength increases as movement paths become more finely resolved. To remedy these flaws with the traditional KDE method, we derive an autocorrelated KDE (AKDE) from first principles to use autocorrelated data, making it perfectly suited for movement data sets. We illustrate the vastly improved performance of AKDE using analytical arguments, relocation data from Mongolian gazelles, and simulations based upon the gazelle’s observed movement process. By yielding better minimum area estimates for threatened wildlife populations, we believe that future widespread use of AKDE will have significant impact on ecology and conservation biology},

FromMay 2013 to February 2014, we used radio-telemetry to determine home-range sizes of 13 adult female T. macrops inhabiting the Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve in Northeast Thailand. We found that individual home ranges for T. macrops averaged 0.175 ha, with activity areas ranging from 0.112-0.303 ha and core areas ranging from 0.023-0.052 ha. Therewas little overlap between conspecific tracked females, especially for the most used areas of their home ranges. We find that T. macrops ambushes more in higher humidity and expresses very little diurnal activity. They use the groundstory for ambushing, then retreat over small distances to higher refuge during the day. Future studies should focus on prey abundance, habitat selection, and survival rates.},

	abstract = {Livestock grazing is the most widespread land-use on Earth, and can have negative effects on biodiversity. Yet, many of the mechanisms by which grazing leads to changes in biodiversity remain unresolved. One reason is that conventional grazing studies often target broad treatments rather than specific parameters of grazing (e.g. intensity, duration and frequency), or fail to account for historical grazing effects. We designed a landscape-scale replicated grazing experiment (15,000 km(2) , 97 sites) to examine the impact of: (i) past grazing management and (ii) present grazing parameters (intensity, duration and frequency) on a community of ground-dependent herpetofauna (39 species). We conducted analyses of community variables (richness and composition) using the full species dataset and multi-season patch-occupancy models (examining local colonization and extinction) for the seven most abundant species. We found past grazing practice did not influence community richness but did affect community composition and patch colonization and extinction for four of seven species. Present grazing parameters did not influence community richness or composition, but six of the seven target species were affected by at least one grazing parameter. Grazing frequency had the most consistent influence, positively affecting three of seven species (increased colonization or decreased extinction). Our study reveals effects of past and present grazing on herpetofauna that have previously been overlooked, providing the following implications for conserving herpetofauna in grazing landscapes: 1) past grazing practice influences community composition and population dynamics in some species in different ways, suggesting conservation programs should target a mosaic of grazing history; 2) species respond differently to specific current grazing practices requiring incentive programs that target a diversity of approaches rather than focussing on a change such as reduced intensity; 3) gathering detailed grazing data to allow determination of fine-scale grazing attributes is essential for advancing grazing as a conservation management strategy.

We describe sex-specific seasonal variation in D. couperi movement patterns and space use in peninsular Florida across multiple temporal scales. We found that males made longer, more frequent movements, and had larger home ranges than females during the winter breeding season.

Phylogenetic factors and local ecology affect female spatial and temporal distributions, which in turn influence the form of male competition, sexual selection and mating systems. In prairie rattlesnake, Crotalus viridis viridis, populations where (1) males seek females during a brief reproductive period, (2) females are relatively few, and (3) females are widely and unpredictably distributed spatially into small discrete clusters, males should show efficient mate searching more so than time-consuming 'handling' (e.g. fighting, mate persuasion). Natural history studies and computer and mathematical modelling generate this expectation. This long-term field study of prairie rattlesnakes in Wyoming indicated that straight-line (i.e. fixed-bearing) movement by males is critical for mate location and, thus, for mating success. Males that searched along straight-line paths located and mated with more females than those having less straight movement paths. Fighting was observed rarely, and no relationship was found between males' success at mate location and body mass and/or snout-vent length. Thus a range of traits may mediate competition and mating success among male snakes.},

	abstract = {How individuals move through their environment dictates which other individuals they encounter, determining their social and reproductive interactions and the extent to which they experience sexual selection. Specifically, females rarely have the option of mating with all males in a population-they can only choose among the males they encounter. Further, quantifying phenotypic differences between the males that females encounter and those that sire females' offspring lends insight into how social and reproductive interactions shape male phenotypes. We used an explicitly spatio-temporal Markov chain model to estimate the number of potential mates ofAnolis sagreilizards from their movement behaviour, and used genetic paternity assignments to quantify sexual selection on males. Females frequently encountered and mated with multiple males, offering ample opportunity for female mate choice. Sexual selection favoured males that were bigger and moved over larger areas, though the effect of body size cannot be disentangled from last-male precedence. Our approach corroborates some patterns of sexual selection previously hypothesized in anoles based on describing them as territorial, whereas other results, including female multiple mating itself, are at odds with territorial polygyny, offering insight into discrepancies in other taxa between behavioural and genetic descriptions of mating systems.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of animal mating systems has changed dramatically with the advent of molecular methods to determine individuals' reproductive success. But why are older behavioral descriptions and newer genetic descriptions of mating systems often seemingly inconsistent? We argue that a potentially important reason for such inconsistencies is a research trajectory rooted in early studies that were equivocal and overreaching, followed by studies that accepted earlier conclusions at face value and assumed, rather than tested, key ideas about animal mating systems. We illustrate our argument using Anolis lizards, whose social behavior has been studied for nearly a century. A dominant view emerging from this behavioral research was that anoles display strict territorial polygyny, where females mate with just the one male in whose territory they reside. However, all genetic evidence suggests that females frequently mate with multiple males. We trace this mismatch to early studies that concluded that anoles are territorial based on limited data. Subsequent research assumed territoriality implicitly or explicitly, resulting in studies that were unlikely to uncover or consider important any evidence of anoles' departures from strict territorial polygyny. . Thus, descriptions of anole behavior were largely led away from predicting a pattern of female multiple mating. We end by considering the broader implications of such erratic trajectories for the study of animal mating systems, and posit that precise definitions, renewed attention to natural history, and explicitly questioning assumptions made while collecting behavioral observations will allow us to move towards a fuller understanding of animal mating systems.},

	abstract = {Socially monogamous birds have provided a major focus of research in the ﬁeld of sexual selection, providing insight into the evolution of ornaments, sexual dimorphism and sex roles. Following important theoretical work in the 1970’s, there has been a continued emphasis on elements of the sexual conﬂict between socially monogamous partners. The application of molecular tools enabled a signiﬁcant research investment into the conﬂict over paternity. The differential allocation hypothesis, has been another well-worked area, focusing attention on the conﬂict over investment with a current or future partner, and being at the forefront of high-proﬁle work on maternal effects. Whilst the conﬂict between the sexes has been a fascinating area of evolutionary biology over the past four decades, I will argue that the level of conﬂict between partners is often overstated, and our understanding of social monogamy is biased by taking the perspective of conﬂict rather than cooperation. For example, differential allocation in socially monogamous birds can be explained from an entirely cooperative perspective, as can much behavior that is currently associated with sperm competition and the conﬂict over paternity. With over 80\% of avian species forming socially monogamous bonds that are often life-long and can last for many decades, we need to redress the balance, and focus more attention on the beneﬁts that both males and females gain from establishing, and maintaining socially monogamous partnerships. I highlight behavioral and morphological adaptations that feature strongly in socially monogamous birds, and that are deserving of more attention from the perspective of the high level of inter-individual cooperation and coordination that undoubtedly exists in many species. Whilst the focus of research has begun to shift recently, it will take many years to redress the bias toward sexual conﬂict that has taken the major share of empirical attention to this point.},
